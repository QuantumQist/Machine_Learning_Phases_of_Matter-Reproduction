# ml_phases_of_matter_reproduction
This repo contains the reproduction of the results corresponding to square lattice Ising model in the paper: Carrasquilla, J., &amp; Melko, R. G. (2017). Machine learning phases of matter. Nature Physics, 13(5), 431-434.

## 1. Training data. 
### 1.1. Download.
The training data can be downloaded from J. Carrasquilla's repository
https://github.com/carrasqu/data_nature_phy_paper

Before running the notebook download all dataseds and extract them to the data folder. The expected format of the directory to the data is given in this example:
`data/L_20/Xtrain.txt`
